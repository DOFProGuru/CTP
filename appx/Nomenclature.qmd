[^eq]: For example, $C_p= a + bt + cT^2 + dT^3$ where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are empirical constants.
[^mm]: There are subtle distictions between molar mass, molecular mass, and molecular weight. For a fairly full discussion read [Wikipedia: Molar mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_mass)
[^xyz]: Often you have to determine from context what sort of fraction it is. When discussing the relationship between mass and mole fractions, $x_i$ is often used for the mass fraction of species $i$ and $y_i$ for mole fraction of species $i$.
        When discussing vapor/liquid equlibrium, $x_i$ is used for the liquid-phase mass or mole fraction of species $i$ and $y_i$ is used for the corresponding vapor-phase fraction of species $i$. $z_i$ is most often used as the overall mass
        or mole fraction of species $i$ in a mixture of vapor and liquid. In such cases, $x_i$ is used for the mass or mol fraction of species $i$ in the liquid, and $y_i$ is used for the mass or mol fraction of species $i$ in the vapor.
[^xystat]: In statistics, $x_i$ is the $i$th measurement or data point and $\bar{x}$ is the arithmetic mean of the data points. For data pairs, $x_i$ is the $i$th independent or specified value, and $y_i$ is the $i$th dependent or 
           measured value.

[^SA]: $S$ is normally used when referring to the total surface area of a catalyst pellet or porous solid. $A$ is normally used for other surface areas, such as a sphere, tube, or reactor.
[^W]: The standard sign convention for Mechanical Engineering is that work out is *positive*. The modern sign convention for Chemical Engineering is that work out is *negative*. Ã‡engel and Boles choose whatever sign convention they feel makes
      the problem easiest.
[^ff]: There are two common friction factors in use. Mechanical Engineers tend to use the *Moody* friction factor, also known as the *Darcy* or *Blasius* friction factor. Chemical Engineers tend to use the *Fanning* friction factor.
       $f_\mathrm{Fanning} = f_\mathrm{Moody}/4$. Be sure to identify which friction factor your tables, charts, and equations use.
