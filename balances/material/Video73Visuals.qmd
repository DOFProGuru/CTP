For one component, how do you calculate phase equilibria?

---


## 1-Component Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE)

From Thermodynamics (p 651 in Çengel & Boles) comes the
*Clapeyron equation*:


$$
\frac{d(p^{*})}{dT} = \frac{\Delta \hat{H}_{v}}{T(\hat{V}_{g} - \hat{V}_l)}
$$

Where $p^*$ is the vapor pressure.

If $\hat{V}_g \gg \hat{V}_l$, and the vapor is ideal, then:

$$
\frac{d(ln p^{*})}{d(1/T)} = - \frac{\Delta \hat{H}_{v}}{R}
$$

---

If in addition, $\Delta \hat{H}_v$ is constant, we can integrate to

$$
ln p^{*} = \frac{\Delta \hat{H}_v}{RT} + B
$$

which is the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

* Empirical equations are also used. The simplest with reasonable accuracy is the Antoine equation:

$$
log_{10} P^{*} = A - \frac{B}{T + C}
$$

where A, B, and C are constants from a table (e.g., Table B.4 on p. 390
in Felder). What are A, B, and C if the substance obeys the ClausiusClapeyron equation?

---

## 2-Component VLE

1-Condensable component, e.g., ethanol-argon. Assume *ideal gas* behavior and that species i is the condensable one, then at saturation
(e.g., two-phases present):

$$
p_i = y_{i}P = p^{*}_{i}(T)
$$

If the temperature is high enough (or pressure low enough) that only
one phase is present then:

$$
p_i = y_{i}P < p^{*}_{i}(T)
$$

At what temperature will condensation begin?

---

$$
p_i = y_{i}P = p^{*}_{i}(T_{dp})
$$


$T_{dp}$ is the dew-point temperature. The difference between $T$ and $T_{dp}$ is the degree(s) of superheat.

---

**Example**: You are standing in the shower with the air and water temperature at 35 °C. What mole-fraction of the air that you are breathing is water?


$$
p_{i} = y_{i}P = p^{*}_{i}(T)
$$

$$
y_{i} = \frac{p_{i}^{*}(T)}{P} 
$$

Get $p_{i}^{*}$ from either Antoine equation or
from Table B.3 in Felder.


---


It is far too simple to use mole fraction when talking to other people
so we have the following definitions (saturation is any gas-vapor
system, humidity is specifically air-water):

*Relative Saturation or Relative Humidity*

$s_r$ or $h_r = \frac{p_i}{p_i^*(T)}*100%$

*Molal Saturation or Molal Humidity*

$s_m$ or $h_m = \frac{p_i} {P-p_i} = \frac{moles of vapor}{moles of vapor-free (dry)gas}$

---


*Absolute Saturation or Absolute Humidity*
$s_m$ or $h_m = \frac{p_{i} M_{i}} {(P-p_i)M_{dry}} = \frac{moles of vapor}{moles of vapor-free (dry)gas}$



*Percentage Saturation or Percentage Humidity*

$s_p$ or $h_p = 100\% \times \frac{s_m} {s_m^*} = 100\% \times \frac{\frac{p_i}{p_i(T)}}{\frac{p_i^*}{p_i^*(T)}}$


---


**Example**: You set out a cold (root)brew on a day when the
temperature is 86 °F and the relative humidity is 30%.

1. At what temperature is the brew when water quits condensing
on the can?
2. What is the dew point?
3. What are the degrees of superheat?

**Solution:**
Need p* at 86 °F (30 °C)

Antoine Equation or Table B.3 in FRB?

**Example(cont):**
Antotine Equation

- $log_10P^* = 8.10765 - \frac{1750.286}{T + 235.000} = 8.10765 - \frac{1750.286}{30 + 235.000} = 1.5028$

- $p^* = 10^{1.5028} = 31.827 mm Hg$

- $p = h_rp^* = 0.30 \times 31.827 mm Hg = 9.548 mm Hg$

- $T_{dp} = \frac{B}{A-log_{10}P} - C = \frac{1750.286}{8.10765 − log_{10} 9.548} - 235.000 = 10.56°C or 51.01 °F$

- $T-T_{dp} = 30-10.56$ = 19.44 °C or 34.99 °F of Superheat

---

**Example(cont):**

Table B.3

- $p^*$ = = 31.824 mm Hg (Table B.3)
- $p = h_{r}p^{*} = 0.30 i 31.824 mm Hg = 9.547 mm Hg$
- $T_{dp}$ =10.54 °C or 50.97 °F
- $T - T_{dp}$ = = 30 −10.54 =19.46 °C or 35.03 °F of Superheat

What about a gas dissolved in a liquid? For dilute solutions,
Henry’s Law holds (A dilute solution is one for which Henry’s law
holds).

$P_A \equiv y_{A}P = x_{A}H_{A}(T)$

In words, the fraction of A dissolved in the liquid phase is directly
proportional to the partial pressure of A in the vapor phase. The
proportionality constant (which can change with temperature) is
the *Henry’s Law Constant*. (See Example 6.4-2 part 1 in *Felder*)
