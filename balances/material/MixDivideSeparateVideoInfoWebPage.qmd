# Definitions

Mixer

:   Mixes or combines multiple input streams into a single output stream. For each species the output stream has a flow equal to the sum of the flow of that species in each input stream. The output stream has a composition equal to the total flow of each species divided by the total flow of all species. Mixers can be as simple as a pipe tee or as complex as a stirred tank.

Divider

:   Divides the input stream into multiple output streams, each with the same composition as the input stream, but with differing flow rates.

Separator

:   Separates the input stream into multiple output streams, each with a different composition than the input stream. If the output streams have the same composition as the input stream, then the separator is a divider. The fraction of a given species in the input stream that exits in a given output stream is the split fraction for that species in that output stream.

Split Fraction

:   The fraction of a given species in the input stream that exits in a given output stream is the *split fraction* for that species in that output stream. For separators with two output streams, the split fractions for a given species in the two output streams sum to 1. For separators with more than two output streams, the split fractions for a given species in all output streams sum to 1.

Composition
:   Composition is the same as the mole or mass fraction of each species in a stream. See [*What the Frac?*](https://youtu.be/qJERzRm7xc0) for more details.
