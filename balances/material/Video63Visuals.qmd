## Real Gases

The ideal gas equation of state is inaccurate at high pressures and
low temperatures. In these cases, the $PVT$ relationship is more
complex. We can categorize the non-ideality of the gas with the
compressibility, $z$.

$$
z \equiv \frac{P\hat{V}}{RT}
$$

The lowest temperature at which there is no transition from liquid
phase to vapor phase with changing pressure is called the critical
temperature, $T_{c\ }$, and the pressure where the liquid and vapor phase
boundaries meet is called the critical pressure, $P_{c\ }$.

## Real Gases (cont.)

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=45%}
At the critical temperature, pressure and molar volume, one can
calculate the critical compressibility, $z_c$.

$$
z_c \equiv \frac{P_c\hat{V}_c}{RT_c}
$$

range from $0.230$ to $0.308$. A table or chart
for $z_c = 0.27$ would be close for many substances.

## Equations of State

A number of models have been developed to fit experimental $PVT$
data. Many of them use three parameters to fit the data, the critical
pressure, $P_{c\ }$, the critical temperature, $T_{c\ }$, and the acentric factor, $\omega$. All
three are determined experimentally. $P_c$ and $T_c$ are usually used to calculate
the reduced temperature, $T_r$, and the reduced pressure, $P_r$. Many other
equations of state, such as Benedict-Webb-Rubin, have additional or
different fitting parameters.

## The Virial Equations of State

The virial equation of state is a series expansion in the specific molar
volume:

$$
z = \frac{P\hat{V}}{RT}+1+\frac{B}{\hat{V}}+\frac{C}{\hat{V}^2}+\frac{D}{\hat{V}^3}+ \dots\ \ .
$$

The series can be truncated depending of the level of accuracy
required. Including just the first term gives:

$$
\frac{P\hat{V}}{RT}=1+\frac{B}{\hat{V}}=1+\frac{BP}{RT}
$$

where $B$ is a function of $P_{c\ }$, $T_{c\ }$, and $\omega$

## The Virial Equations of State (cont.)

For moderate temperatures and pressures, B can be calculated as:

$$
B_0 = 0.083 - \frac{0.422}{T_r^{1.6}}
$$

$$
B_1 =  0.139 - \frac{0.172}{T_r^{4.2}}
$$

$$
B = \frac{RT_c}{P_c}(B_0 + \omega B_1)
$$

The truncated virial equation has a less than 2% error for $P_r < 2.0$
and $1 + B_0P_r/T_r > 0.8$.

## The Virial Equations of State (cont.)

Using the compressibility, z, the truncated virial equation can be
written as

$$
z = z_0 + \omega z_1
$$

where

$$
z_0 = 1 + B_0 \frac{P_r}{T_r}
$$

and

$$
z_1 = B_1 \frac{P_r}{T_r}
$$


## The Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation of State{.bigbold80}

:::{style="font-size: 90px;"}
From family of cubic equations of state

$$
P = \frac{RT}{\hat{V} - b} - \frac{\alpha a}{\hat{V}(\hat{V}+b)}
$$

where

$$
a = 042747 \frac{(RT_c)^2}{P_c},\ \ \ b = 0.08664 \frac{RT_c}{P_c},\ \ \ \alpha = [1+m(1-\sqrt{T_r})]^2
$$

and

$$
m = 0.48508 + 1.5517 \omega - 0.1561 \omega^2
$$

## Example

In Part 2, we will do the following example:


> A stream of propane at $T = 423\ \mathrm{K}$ and $P = 70\ \mathrm{atm}$, is flowing at a
rate of $100.0\ \mathrm{kmol/h}$. Estimate the volumetric flow rate with ideal
gas, generalized compressibility charts, and SRK. The measured specific volume of
propane at $423\ \mathrm{K}$ and $70\ \mathrm{atm}$ is $0.2579\ \mathrm{L/mol}$.


## The Takeaways

1. Real gases are characterized by at least two experimental parameters, $P_c$ and $T_c$.
2. When a third parameter is needed for greater accuracy, the acentric factor, $\omega$, is used.
3. Real-gas properties can be characterized graphically with the generalized compressibility charts.
4. Real-gas properties can also be characterized by equations of state, such as the virial equation and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation.
