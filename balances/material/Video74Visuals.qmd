## Multicomponent Systems

If the vapor phase is an ideal-gas mixture and the liquid phase is
an ideal solution then Raoult’s Law holds.

$$
p_\mathrm{A} \equiv y_\mathrm{A}P = x_\mathrm{A}p_\mathrm{A}^*(T)
$$

or in terms of species $i$,

$$
y_{i}P = x_{i}p_{i}^{*}(T) (i=1, 2, 3, .., N)
$$ {#eq-raoults}

In words, the partial pressure of a component is equal to the liquid
mole fraction of the component times its vapor pressure.
(If the vapor phase is not an ideal-gas mixture or the liquid phase
is not an ideal solution then we are led to the realms of activity
coefficients, fugacities and Poynting factors, i.e., the advanced phase equilibria videos)

## BUBL, DEW, FLASH

For multicomponent mixtures, five types of calculations are usually performed using Raoult’s law:

1. BUBL P – Given all $x_{i}$’s and $T$, calculate $P$ at which the first
bubble forms, and $y_{i}$’s of the bubble.
2. BUBL T – Given all $x_{i}$’s and $P$, calculate $T$ at which the first
bubble forms, and $y_{i}$’s of the bubble.
3. DEW P – Given all $y_{i}$’s and $T$, calculate $P$ at which the first
droplet condenses, and $x_{i}$’s of the droplet.
4. DEW T – Given all $y_{i}$’s and $P$, calculate $T$ at which the first
droplet condenses, and $x_{i}$’s of the droplet.
5. FLASH – Given overall composition ($z_{i}$’s) and $T$ and $P$, calculate
$x_{i}$’s and $y_{i}$’s, and relative amounts of vapor, $\mathcal{V}$, and liquid, $\mathcal{L}$.

## BUBL P

Given all $x_{i}$’s and $T$, calculate $P$ and $y_{i}$’s.

If necessary, begin by calculating all of the vapor pressures from the
Antoine equation.

$$
p_{i}^{*} = 10^{A_{i} - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}}
$$ {#eq-BP1}

Raoult's Law, @eq-raoults, $$y_{i}P = x_{i}p_{i}^{*}(T)\ \ \ (i=1, 2, 3, .., N)$$

can be rearranged as: 

$$P =  \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{i}p_{i}^{*}
$$ {#eq-BP3}

to calculate $P$. Then calculate $y_{i}$'s from:

$$y_{i} = \frac{x_{i} p_{i}^*} {P}\ \ \ (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)$$ {#eq-BP4}

---

## DEW P

Given all $y_{i}$'s and $T$, calculate $P$ and $x_{i}$'s.
If necessary, begin by calculating all of the vapor pressures from the
Antoine equation, @eq-BP1.


$$p_{i}^{*} = 10^{A_{i} - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}}$$



Raoult's Law, @eq-raoults, rearranged, gives

$$x_{i} = \frac{y_{i} P} {p_{i}^{*}}\ \ \ (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N).
$$ {#eq-DP2}

Also

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i =1
$$ {#eq-DP3}

---

Then,

$$
1 =P \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{y_i} {p_{i}^{*}}
$$ {#eq-DP4}


and

$$
P = \frac {1} {\sum\limits_{i=i}^{N}\frac{y_i} {p_{i}^{*}}}
$$ {#eq-DP5}


to calculate $P$. Then calculate $x_i$'s from @eq-DP2.

## The Takeaways

1. Vapor-Liquid Equilibria (VLE) calculations for binaries can be done with a $Pxy$ or $Txy$ phase diagram.
2. For binary mixtures that are ideal solutions in the liquid phase and ideal gases in the vapor phase, VLE calculations can be done with Raoult's law and the Antoine equation.
3. The five classes of calculations from easiest to hardest are: Bubble P, Dew P, Bubble T, Dew T, and Flash.
4. However, flash calculations for binary mixtures are relatively straightforward.

Graphical BUBL $T$, DEW $T$

![](TxyDiagram320KTemp.png)

---

## BUBL T

Given all $x_{i}$’s and $P$, calculate $T$ and $y_i$’s

In general, an iterative solution is required. With a spreadsheet, the
easiest method is to guess a temperature $T_\mathrm{guess}$.

Calculate all of the vapor pressures from the Antoine equation, @eq-BP1,

$$
p_{i}^{*} = 10^{A_{i} - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}}\ \ \ (i=1,2,3,.., N)
$$

Then calculate the pressure from the guessed temperature

$$
P_\mathrm{guess} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}p_{i}^{*}
$$ {#eq-BT2}

---


Set up a cell to calculate the difference between the actual pressure
and the guessed pressure, $P_\mathrm{actual} - P_\mathrm{guess}$.

Have *Goal Seek* set the difference to 0 by varying $T_\mathrm{guess}$.

$T_\mathrm{guess}$ is now the correct temperature. You can calculate the $y_i$’s from Raoult’s law, @eq-DP2,


$$
y_{i} = \frac{x_{i}p_{i}^{*}}{P}\ \ \ (i=1,2,3,...,N)
$$

**Alternate Method:** In a spreadsheet, guess a $T$. For one component
calculate $p_{k}^{*}$ from @eq-BT5 and calculate $p_{i}^{*}$ from the Antoine equation, @eq-BP1. Set a cell as the error between the two and goal seek to set that cell to $0$ by varying $T$.

**Note:** For a two-component system, if you are determining the $y_i$’s as a function of $T$ at constant $P$, you don’t need to iterate. Choose values of $T$ between $T_\mathrm{b1}$ and $T_\mathrm{b2}$, and calculate the $y_i$’s using the Antoine equation, @eq-BP1 and Raoult’s law, @eq-DP2.


---

If you prefer programming to spreadsheets, begin by picking an
arbitrary component, $k$, then:

$$
P = p_{k}^{*} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \frac{p_{i}^{*}}{p_{k}^{*}}
$$ {#eq-BT4}

or


$$
p_{k}^{*} = \frac{P}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \alpha_{ik}}
$$ {#eq-BT5}


where the relative voltatility, $\alpha_{ik}$, is defined as:


$$
\alpha_{ik} \equiv \frac{p_{i}^{*}}{p_{k}^{*}}
$$ {#eq-BT6}


---

If the vapor pressures are related by the Antoine equation, @eq-BP1:

$$
\log_{10} p^* = A - \frac{B}{T + C}
$$ 

then we can calculate,

$$
\log_{10}\alpha_{ik} = A_i - A_k - \frac{B_i}{T + C_i} + \frac{B_k}{T + C_k}
$$ {#eq-BT8}

One can begin the iteration with an initial guess

$$
T_{0} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}T_{i}^{*}
$$ {#eq-BT9}


---

This $T_{0}$ can be used to evaluate all of the $\alpha_{ik}$’s in @eq-BT6, which are then
used in @eq-BT5 to calculate $p_k^*$, from which a new value of $T$ can be
calculated from:


$$
T_1 = \frac{B_k} {A_{k} - \log_{10} p_{k}^{*} - C_{k}}
$$ \{#eq-BT10}

The iteration is repeated until $T$ doesn’t change much from one
iteration to the next. The Antoine equation, @eq-BP1 is then used to calculate all $p_i^*$, then use
Raoult’s law, @eq-DP2 to calculate the $y_i$’s.


---

## DEW T

Given all $y_i$’s and $P$, calculate $T$ and $x_i$’s.

In general, an iterative solution very similar to BUBL T is required.
With a spreadsheet, the easiest method is to guess a temperature $T_\mathrm{guess}$ .

Calculate all of the vapor pressures, $p_i^*$'s, from the Antoine equation, @eq-BP1


$$
P_{i}^{*} = 10 ^ {A - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}}\ \ \ (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$


Then calculate the pressure from the guessed temperature using @eq-DP5,

$$
P_\mathrm{guess} = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}\frac{y_i}{p_{i}^{*}}}
$$


---

Set up a cell to calculate the difference between the actual pressure
and the guessed pressure, $P_\mathrm{actual} - P_\mathrm{guess}$.

Have Goal Seek set the difference to $0$ by varying $T_\mathrm{guess}$.

$T_\mathrm{guess}$ is now the correct temperature. You can calculate the $x_i$’s from
Raoult’s law, @eq-DP2,

$$
x_i = \frac{y_{i} P} {p_{i}^{*}}\ \ \ (i = 1,2,3, ..., N)
$$


**Alternate Method**: As before, in a spreadsheet, guess a $T$. For one
component calculate $p_{k}^{*}$ from @eq-DT5 and calculate $p_{i}^{*}$ from the Antoine equation, @eq-BP1. Set a
cell as the error between the two and goal seek to set that cell to 0 by
varying $T$.


---

If you prefer programming to spreadsheets, begin by picking an
arbitrary component, $k$, then:

$$
P = \frac{p_{k}^{*}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}\frac{p_{k}^{*}}{p_{i}^{*}}}
$$ {#eq-DT4}

or

$$
p_{k}^{*} = P \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{y_j}{\alpha_{ik}}
$$ {#eq-DT5}

where the relative volatility, $\alpha_{ki}$, is defined in @eq-BT6 and calculated
using @eq-BT8.

---

The initial guess is:

$$
T_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}T_{i}^{*}
$$ {#eq-DT6}


This $T_0$ can be used to evaluate all of the $a_{ik}$’s in @eq-BT6 which are then
used in @eq-BT5 to calculate $p_{k}^{*}$, from which a new value of $T$ can be
calculated from @eq-BT10:


$$
T_1 = \frac{B_k}{A_k - \log_{10} p_{k}^{*}} - C_k
$$



After convergence we evaluate the $x_i$’s from Raoult’s law, @eq-DP2:

$$
x_i = \frac {y_{i}P}{p_{i}^{*}}\ \ \ (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$

## The Takeaways

1. Vapor-Liquid Equilibria (VLE) calculations for binaries can be done with a $Pxy$ or $Txy$ phase diagram.
2. For binary mixtures that are ideal solutions in the liquid phase and ideal gases in the vapor phase, VLE calculations can be done with Raoult's law and the Antoine equation.

## FlASH


Given $z_i$’s and $T$ and $P$, calculate $x_i$’s and $y_{i}$’s, and relative amounts of
vapor, $\mathcal{V}$, and liquid, $\mathcal{L}$.

$$
\mathcal{V} \equiv \frac{n_\mathrm{{vapor}}}{n_\mathrm{{total}}}
$$ {#eq-F1}

and

$$
\mathcal{L} \equiv \frac{n_\mathrm{{liquid}}}{n_\mathrm{{total}}}
$$ {#eq-F2}

so

$$
\mathcal{L} + \mathcal{V} = 1
$$ {#eq-F3}


---

and 

$$
z_{i} = x_{i}\mathcal{L} + y_{i}\mathcal{V}\ \ \ (i=1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$ {#eq-F4}

or

$$
z_{i} = x_{i}(1-\mathcal{V}) + y_{i}\mathcal{V}\ \ \ (i= 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$ {#eq-F5}

We will now use the *K-value* or distribution coefficient, defined
as

$$
K_{i} \equiv \frac{p_{i}^{*}}{P}
$$ {#eq-F6}



---

which for Raoult’s law yields

$$
K_{i} = \frac{y_i}{x_i}
$$ {#eq-F7}

or


$$
x_{i} = \frac{y_i}{K_i}
$$ {#eq-F8}


Substitution into @eq-F5 yields

$$
y_{i} = \frac{z_{i}K_{i}}{1+\mathcal{V} (K_{i} - 1) }\ \ \ (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$ {#eq-F9}



---

or


$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{z_{i}K_{i}}{1 + \mathcal{V} (K_{i} -1)} = 1
$$ {#eq-F10}

which is solved for $\mathcal{V}$ by numerical methods (such as Goal Seek). Then
find the $y_{i}$ from @eq-F9 and the $x_{i}$ from @eq-F8.

For a binary, there is an analytical method for solving for $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{V}$.
Discovering the method is left as an exercise to the viewer.




---

## Example

The binary system benzene(1)/toluene(2) conforms closely to Raoult’s law.
Vapor pressures for the pure species are given by the following Antoine
equations:


$$
\log_{10} p_\mathrm{b}^{*} / \mathrm{bar} = 4.01814 - \frac{1203.835}{T /\mathrm{K}  - 53.226}
$$

$$
\log_{10}p_\mathrm{t}^{*} / \mathrm{bar} = 4.07827 - \frac{1343.943}{T / \mathrm{K} - 53.773}
$$



1. Prepare a graph showing $P$ vs. $x_b$ and $P$ vs. $y_b$ for a temperature of
100°C.

2. Prepare a graph showing $T$ vs. $x_b$ and $T$ vs. $y_b$ for a pressure of 1 bar

---

For a $Pxy$ diagram, we need $P$ as a function of $x_1$, and $P$ as a function
of $y_1$, or $x_1$ and $y_1$ as a function of $P$. From @eq-BP3

$$
P = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}p_{i}^{*} + (1-x_{i})p_{2}^{*} = (p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}) x_1 + p_{2}^{*}
$$

which is a linear function of $x_1$ that runs from $p_{2}^{*}$ at $x_1$ = 0
to $p_{1}^{*}$ at $x_1$ =1.

From @eq-DP5

$$
P = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \frac{y_i}{p_{1}^{*}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{y_1}{p_{1}^{*}} + \frac{1-y_1}{p_{2}^{*}}} = \frac{p_{1}^{*}p_{2}^{*}}{(p_{2}^{*} - p_{1}^{*}) y_1 + p_{1}^{}*}
$$

$p_{1}^{*}$ and $p_{2}^{*}$ are determined from the Antoine equations.


---

$P$ vs. $x_1$ and $P$ vs. $y_1$ for a temperature of 100°C.

![](PxyBenzeneToluene.png)


---

For a $T_{xy}$ diagram, we either need to use Goal Seek or we need $x_1$ and
$y_1$ as a function of $T$. From From @eq-BP3


$$
P = (p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}) x_1 + p_{2}^{*}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow x_1 = \frac{P-p_{2}^{*}}{p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}}
$$

Pick a a series of temperatures between $T_\text{1-bp}$ and $T_\text{2-bp}$ and calculate $p_{1}^{*}$
and $p_{2}^{*}$ and then $x_1$.


From @eq-DP5

$$
P = \frac{p_{1}^{*}p_{2}^{*}}{(p_{2}^{*}-p_{1}^{*}) y_{1} + p_{1}^{*}}
$$


$$
\Rightarrow y_1 = \frac{p_{1}^{*}}{P} \frac{P-p_{2}^{*}}{p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}}
$$

Pick a series of temperatures between $T_\text{1-bp}$ and $T_\text{2-bp}$ and calculate $p_{1}^{*}$
and $p_{2}^{*}$ and then $y_1$.

## The Takeaways

1. Vapor-Liquid Equilibria (VLE) calculations for binaries can be done with a Pxy or Txy phase diagram.
2. For binary mixtures that are ideal solutions in the liquid phase and ideal gases in the vapor phase, VLE calculations can be done with Raoult's law and the Antoine equation.
3. The five classes of calculations from easiest to hardest are: Bubble P, Dew P, Bubble T, Dew T, and Flash.
4. However, flash calculations for binary mixtures are relatively straightforward.
