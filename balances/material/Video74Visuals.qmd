## Multicomponent Systems

If the vapor phase is an ideal-gas mixture and the liquid phase is
an ideal solution then Raoult’s Law holds.

$$
P_A \equiv y_{A}P = x_{A}p_{A}^{*}(T)
$$

or in terms of species i,

$$
y_{i}P = x_{i}p_{i}^{*}(T) (i=1, 2, 3, .., N)
$$

In words, the partial pressure of a component is equal to the liquid
mole fraction of the component times its vapor pressure.
(If the vapor phase is not an ideal-gas mixture or the liquid phase
is not an ideal solution then we are led to the realms of activity
coefficients, fugacities and Poynting factors, i.e., E134)

---

## For multicomponent mixtures, five types of calculations are usually performed using Raoult’s law:

1. BUBL P – Given all $x_{i}$’s and T, calculate P at which the first
bubble forms, and $y_{i}$’s of the bubble.
2. BUBL T – Given all $x_{i}$’s and P, calculate T at which the first
bubble forms, and $y_{i}$’s of the bubble.
3. DEW P – Given all $y_{i}$’s and T, calculate P at which the first
droplet condenses, and $x_{i}$’s of the droplet.
4. DEW T – Given all $y_{i}$’s and P, calculate T at which the first
droplet condenses, and $x_{i}$’s of the droplet.
5. FLASH – Given overall composition ($z_{i}$’s) and T and P, calculate
$x_{i}$’s and $y_{i}$’s, and relative amounts of vapor, V, and liquid, L.

## BUBL P

Given all $x_{i}$’s and $T$, calculate $P$ and $y_{i}$’s.

If necessary, begin by calculating all of the vapor pressures from the
Antoine Equation.

$$
p_{i}^{*} = 10^{A_{i} - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}}
$$ 
(BP 1)

Raoult's Law, $y_{i}P = x_{i}p_{i}^{*}(T) (i=1, 2, 3, .., N)$ (BP 2)

can be rearranged as: 

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{i}p_{i}^{*}
$$
 (BP 3)

to calculate $P$. Then calculate $y_{i}$'s from:

$y_{i} = \frac{x_{i} p_{i}^*} {P} (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)$ (BP 4)

---


## DEW P

Given all $y_{i}$'s and $T$, calculate $P$ and $x_{i}$'s.
If necessary, begin by calculating all of the vapor pressures from the
Antoine Equation.


$$p_{i}^{*} = 10^{A_{i} - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}}$$
 (DP 1)


Given from Raoult's Law,

$$x_{i} = \frac{y_{i} P} {p_{i}^{*}} (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$ 
(DP 2)

and

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i =1
$$
(DP 3)

---

Then,

$$
1 =P \sum_{i=i}^{N}\frac{y_i} {p_{i}^{*}}
$$ 
(DP 4)


and

$$
P = \frac {1} {\sum_{i=i}^{N}\frac{y_i} {p_{i}^{*}}}
$$ 
(DP 5)


to caluclate $P$. Then calculate $x_i$'s from (DP 2).

## BUBL T

Given all $x_{i}$’s and $P$, calculate $T$ and $y_i$’s

In general, an iterative solution is required. With a spreadsheet, the
easiest method is to guess a temperature $T_{guess}$.

Calculate all of the vapor pressures from the Antoine Equation

$$
p_{i}^{*} = 10^{A_{i} - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}} (i=1,2,3,.., N)
$$ 
(BP 1)

Then calculate the pressure from the guessed temperature

$$
P_{guess} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}p_{i}^{*}$ (BT 2)
$$

---


Set up a cell to calculate the difference between the actual pressure
and the guessed pressure, $P_{actual} - P_{guess}$.

Have *Goal Seek* set the difference to 0 by varying $T_{guess}$.

$T_{guess}$ is now the correct temperature. You can calculate the $y_i$’s from Raoult’s law,


$$
y_{i} = \frac{x_{i}p_{i}^{*}}{P} (i=1,2,3,...,N)
$$
 (BT 3)

**Alternate Method:** In a spreadsheet, guess a $T$. For one component
calculate $p_{k}^{*}$ from BT 5 and calculate $p_{i}^{*}$ from BT 1. Set a cell as the error between the two and goal seek to set that cell to 0 by varying T.

**Note:** For a two-component system, if you are determining the $y_i$’s as a function of $T$ at constant $P$, you don’t need to iterate. Choose values of $T$ between $T_{b1}$ and $T_{b2}$, and calculate the $y_i$’s using (BT 1) and (BT 3).


---

If you prefer programming to spreadsheets, begin by picking an
arbitrary component, $k$, then:

$$
P = p_{k}^{*} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \frac{p_{i}^{*}}{p_{k}^{*}}
$$ 
(BT4)

or


$$
p_{k}^{*} = \frac{P}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} a_{ik}}
$$ 
(BT 5)


where the relative voltatility, $a_{ik}$, is defined as:


$$
a_{ik} \equiv \frac{p_{i}^{*}}{p_{k}^{*}}
$$ 
(BT6)


---

If the vapor pressures are related by the Antoine equation:

$$
\log_{10} p^* = A - \frac{B}{T + C}
$$ 
(BT 7)

then we can calculate,

$$
\log_{10}a_{ik} = A_i - A_k - \frac{B_i}{T + C_i} + \frac{B_k}{T + C_k}
$$ 

(BT 8)

One can begin the iteration with an initial guess

$$
T_{0} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}T_{i}^{*}
$$
(BT 9)


---

This $T_{0}$ can be used to evaluate all of the a_{ik}’s in (BT 6) which are then
used in (BT 5) to calculate $pk*$, from which a new value of $T$ can be
calculated from:


$$
T_1 = \frac{B_k} {A_{k} - \log_{10} p_{k}^{*} - C_{k}}
$$ 

(BT 10)

The iteration is repeated until $T$ doesn’t change much from one
iteration to the next. (BT 7) is then used to calculate all $p_i$*’s, then use
(BT 3) to calculate the $y_i$’s.


---

## DEW T

Given all yi’s and P, calculate T and xi’s.

In general, an iterative solution very similar to BUBL T is required.
With a spreadsheet, the easiest method is to guess a temperature Tguess .

Calculate all of the vapor pressures, pi* , from the Antoine Equation


$$
P_{i}^{*} = 10 ^ {A - \frac{B_i}{T+C_i}} (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N) (DT 1)
$$


Then calculate the pressure from the guessed temperature,

$$
P_{guess} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{y_i}{p_{i}^{*}}} (DT 2)
$$


---

Set up a cell to calculate the difference between the actual pressure
and the guessed pressure, $P_{actual}$ – $P_{guess}$.

Have Goal Seek set the difference to 0 by varying T_{guess}.

T_{guess} is now the correct temperature. You can calculate the $x_i$’s from
Raoult’s law,

$$
x_i = \frac{y_{i} P} {p_{i}^{*}} (i = 1,2,3, ..., N) (DT 3)
$$


**Alternate Method**: As before, in a spreadsheet, guess a $T$. For one
component calculate $p_{k}^{*}$ from DT 5 and calculate $p_{i}^{*}$ from DT 1. Set a
cell as the error between the two and goal seek to set that cell to 0 by
varying $T$.


---

If you prefer programming to spreadsheets, begin by picking an
arbitrary component, k, then:

$$
P = \frac{p_{k}^{*}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}\frac{p_{k}^{*}}{p_{i}^{*}}}
$$
(DT 4)

or

$$
p_{k}^{*} = P \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{y_j}{a_{ik}}
$$

(DT 5)

where the relative volatility, $a_{ki}$, is defined in (BT 6) and calculated
using (BT 8).

---

The initial guess is:

$$
T_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}T_{i}^{*}
$$

(DT 6)


This $T_0$ can be used to evaluate all of the $a_{ik}$’s in (BT 6) which are then
used in (BT 5) to calculate $p_{k}^{*}$, from which a new value of T can be
calculated from:


$$
T_1 = \frac{B_k}{A_k - \log_{10} p_{k}^{*}} - C_k
$$

(DT 7)


After convergence we evaluate the $x_i$’s from:

$$
x_i = \frac {y_{i}P}{p_{i}^{*}} (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$

(DT 8)

## FlASH


Given $z_i$’s and $T$ and $P$, calculate $x_i$’s and $y_{i}$’s, and relative amounts of
vapor, $V$, and liquid, $L$.

#### Chen's question
#### Are V and L the notation from the slides


$$
V \equiv \frac{n_{vapor}}{n_{total}}
$$
(F1)

and

$$
L \equiv \frac{n_{liquid}}{n_{total}}
$$
(F2)

so

$$
L + V = 1
$$
(F3)


---

and 

$$
z_{i} = x_{i}L + y_{i}V (i=1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$
(F 4)

or

$$
z_{i} = x_{i}(1-V) y_{i}V (i= 1, 2, 3, ..., N) (F 5)
$$

We will now use the*K-value* or distribution coefficient, defined
as

$$
K_{i} \equiv \frac{p_{i}^{*}}{P}
$$
(F 6)



---

which for Raoult’s law yields

$$
K_{i} = \frac{y_i}{x_i}
$$
(F 7)

or


$$
x_{i} = \frac{y_i}{K_i}
$$
(F 8)


Substitution into (F 5) yields

$$
y_{i} = \frac{z_{i}K_{i}}{1+\nu (K_{i} - 1) } (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
$$
(F 9)



---

or


$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{z_{i}K_{i}}{1 + \nu (K_{i} -1)} = 1
$$

(F 10)

which is solved for $\nu$ by numerical methods (such as Goal Seek). Then
find the $y_{i}$ from (F 9) and the $x_{i}$ from (F 8).

For a binary, there is an analytical method for solving for $L$ and $\nu$.
Discovering the method is left as an exercise to the viewer.

## Example

The binary system benzene(1)/toluene(2) conform closely to Raoult’s law.
Vapor pressures for the pure species are given by the following Antoine
equations:


$$
\log_{10} p_{b}^{*} / mmHg = 6.89272 - \frac{1203.531}{T / °C + 219.888}
$$

$$
\log_{10}p_{t}^{*} / mmHg = 6.5805 - /frac{1346.773}{T / °C + 219.693}
$$

100°C.

2. Prepare a graph showing $T$ vs. $x_b$ and $T$ vs. $y_b$ for a pressure of 1 atm

For a $P_{xy}$ diagram, we need $P$ as a function of $x_1$, and $P$ as a function
of $y_1$, or $x_1$ and $y_1$ as a function of $P$. From Equation (BP 3)

$$
P = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}p_{i}^{*} + (1-x_{i})p_{2}^{*} = (p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}) x_1 + p_{2}^{*}
$$

which is a linear function of $x_1$ that runs from $p_{2}^{*}$ at $x_1$ = 0
to $p_{1}^{*}$ at $x_1$ =1.

From Equation (DP 5)

$$
P = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{y_i}{p_{1}^{*}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{y_1}{p_{1}^{*}} + \frac{1-y_1}{p_{2}^{*}}} = \frac{p_{1}^{*}p_{2}^{*}}{(p_{2}^{*} - p_{1}^{*}) y_1 + p_{1}^{}*}
$$

$p_{1}^{*}$ and $p_{2}^{*}$ are determined from the Antoine equation.

For a $T_{xy}$ diagram, we either need to use Goal Seek or we need $x_1$ and
$y_1$ as a function of $T$. From Equation (BP 3)


$$
P = (p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}) x_1 + p_{2}^{*}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow x_1 = \frac{P-p_{2}^{*}}{p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}}
$$

Picka a series of temperatures between $T_{1-bp}$ and $T_{2-bp}$ and calculate $p_{1}^{*}$
and $p_{2}^{*}$ and then $x_1$.


From Equation (DP 5)

$$
P = \frac{p_{1}^{*}p_{2}^{*}}{(p_{2}^{*}-p_{1}^{*}) y_{1} + p_{1}^{*}}
$$


$$
\Rightarrow y_1 = \frac{p_{1}^{*}}{P} \frac{P-p_{2}^{*}}{p_{1}^{*} - p_{2}^{*}}
$$

Pick a series of temperatures between $T_{1-bp}$ and $T_{2-bp}$ and calculate $p_{1}^{*}$
and $p_{2}^{*}$ and then $y_1$.
