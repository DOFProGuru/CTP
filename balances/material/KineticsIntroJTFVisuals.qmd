## A Single Chemical Reaction

$$
\nu_\mathrm{B} \mathrm{B} + \nu_\mathrm{C} \mathrm{C} + \cdots \rightarrow \nu_\mathrm{P} \mathrm{P} + \nu_\mathrm{S} \mathrm{S} + \cdots
$$

$$
\sum \nu_i \mathrm{A}_i = 0
$$

$\nu_i$ – stoichometric coefficient for component $i$.

$\nu_i$ is positive for products (right side) and negative for reactants (left side).

**Reaction Rate**

$\ \ \ \ r \equiv \frac{1}{\nu_i} \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_i}{dt}$

$\ \ \ \ r_i = \nu_i r$

**Individual Reaction Rates**

$\ \ \ \ r_\mathrm{B} \equiv \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_\mathrm{B}}{dt} = \nu_\mathrm{B} r$

$\ \ \ \ r_\mathrm{C} \equiv \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_\mathrm{C}}{dt}  = \nu_\mathrm{C} r$

$\ \ \ \ r_\mathrm{P} \equiv \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_\mathrm{P}}{dt}  = \nu_\mathrm{P} r$

$\ \ \ \ r_\mathrm{S} \equiv \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_\mathrm{S}}{dt} = \nu_\mathrm{S} r$

## Constant Density Reactors

If the mass density, $\rho$ doesn't change appreciably during reaction (e.g., aqueous solutions) or the total number of moles is fixed, i.e., $\nu = \sum \nu_j = 0$, then 

$\ \ \ \ \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_\mathrm{B}}{dt}$

can be written as

$\ \ \ \ \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_\mathrm{B}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{n_\mathrm{B}}{V}\right) = \frac{dC_\mathrm{B}}{dt}$

or

$\ \ \ \ r_\mathrm{B} = \frac{dC_\mathrm{B}}{dt}$

:::{.callout-note}
We will limit ourselves to constant density reactors for most of the DOFPro videos. The ones that delve deeper into chemical reactor engineering will relax this constraint.

## Extent of Reaction

The reaction rate can vary with position. The extent of reaction is for the reactor as a whole, so the reaction rate is integrated over the reaction volume to get the extent.

$\ \ \ \ \xi = \frac{n_i - n_{i_0}}{\nu_i}$

$\ \ \ \ \dot{\xi} = \frac{\dot{n}_i - \dot{n}_{i_0}}{\nu_i}$

$\ \ \ \ \frac{d \xi}{dt} = \frac{1}{\nu_i} \frac{dn_i}{dt}$

$\ \ \ \ r = \frac{1}{\nu_i} \frac{1}{V} \frac{dn_i}{dt} = \frac{1}{V} \frac{d \xi}{dt}$

## Multiple Reactions

$$
n_i = n_{i_0} + \sum_{j=1}^J \nu_{ij} \xi_j
$$


$$
\dot{n}_i = \dot{n}_{i_0} + \sum_{j=1}^J \nu_{ij} \dot{\xi}_j
$$


## Fractional Conversion

$$
f_k = \frac{n_{k_0} - n_k}{n_{k_0}}
$$

$$
f_k = \frac{\dot{n}_{k_0} - \dot{n}_k}{\dot{n}_{k_0}}
$$


## $r$ as a Function of $T$ and $C$

In general, $r$ varies as a function of $T$ and $C$ or $a$ (activity).

$\ \ \ \ r=r(T,\ C_\mathrm{B},\ C_\mathrm{C},\ \dots)$

There are many forms. We will only work with

$\ \ \ \ r = k C_\mathrm{B}^n C_\mathrm{C}^m$

where the *rate coefficient*, $k$, is

$\ \ \ \ k = k_0 e^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}$

and the *order of reaction* with respect to $\mathrm{B}$ is $n$, the order of reaction with respect to $\mathrm{C}$ is $m$, and the overall order is $n + m$.

:::{style="font-size: 60px;"}
Yes, we know that using $n$ for both number of moles, and order of reaction is confusing. That's just how it's done. Deal with it.

Did we mention that $C$ is concentration, and $\mathrm{C}$ is species $\mathrm{C}$ as well as carbon? It's like why the main streets in Boston don't have street signs. It's obvious what street  you're on and if it isn't you don't belong here.

## Mole Balance on Reactor

Reactor volume, $V_R$

**General Balance Equation**

$\ \ \ \ \mathrm{In - Out + Generation = Accumulation}$

$\ \ \ \ \dot{n}_{j_0} - \dot{n}_j + \mathrm{Gen}_j = \frac{dn_j}{dt}$

$\ \ \ \ \mathrm{Gen}_j = \int_{V_R} r_j dV,\ \ \ \ r_j = \nu_j r$

$$
\dot{n}_{j_0} - \dot{n}_j + \int_{V_R} r_j dV = \frac{dn_j}{dt}
$$

## The Takeaways

1. For reactors with multiple reactions occurring, there is often one desired reaction product and one or more undesired reaction product.
2. The yield is the fraction of the desired product that could be produced that is actually produced..
3. The selectivity is the ratio of the desired product to the undesired products.
4. Don’t confuse mole fraction, $x_\mathrm{A} = n_\mathrm{A}/(\sum n_i)$, split fraction, $t_{A1} = \dot{n}_\mathrm{A1}/\dot{n}_\mathrm{Ain}$, and fractional conversion.$f_\mathrm{A} = (\dot{n}_\mathrm{A_{in}} - \dot{n}_\mathrm{A_{out}})/\dot{n}_\mathrm{A_{in}}$.
