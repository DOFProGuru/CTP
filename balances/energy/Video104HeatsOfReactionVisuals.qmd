##

If we have a chemical reaction, such as


$$
aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD
$$



We can run it in an isothermal chemical reactor, either as an open
steady-state system or as a closed constant-pressure system.

$$
\Delta \hat{H}_r = \dfrac{\Delta H}{\xi} = \dfrac{Q}{\xi} \text{ or } \dfrac{\dot{H}}{\dot{\xi}} = \dfrac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{\xi}}
$$

##

The *heat of reaction* or *enthalpy of reaction* depends on how you
write the chemical equation. If you double the stoichiometric
coefficients, you double the heat of reaction.

<br></br>

The heat of reaction is a function of temperature. At the standard
reference temperature ($25\text{ } ^{\circ}\text{C}$ for E82), the heat of reaction is the
*standard heat of reaction*.

<br></br>

To calculate the heat of reaction at a temperature other than the
standard temperature, you have to take into account any sensible
heat changes and any phase changes since $H$ is a state function.

## Heat of Formation

The *heat of formation* or *enthalpy of formation* is the standard
heat of reaction for forming one mole of product, starting from
pure elements at their standard form of aggregation at $T_{ref}$. For
example, the standard states at $25\text{ } ^{\circ}\text{C}$ for oxygen and nitrogen are
the diatomic gases $\textrm{O}_2$(g) and $\textrm{N}_2$(g). The standard heat of formation
for any element in its standard form of aggregation is $0$ by
definition.

<br></br>

You can calculate the standard heat of reaction for any reaction as
the sum of the heats of formation times the stoichiometric
coefficients. Don’t forget phase changes.


$$
\Delta H^{\circ}_r = \sum v_i \Delta H^{\circ}_{f, i}
$$



## Hess's Law

The energetics of any reaction can be calculated by algebraically
adding together any set of reactions that gives you the same
overall reaction as the one you want.

<br>

Example $9.2-1$ from FRB.

 1. $\textrm{C}_2 \textrm{H}_6 + \dfrac{7}{2} \textrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\textrm{C}\textrm{O}_2 + 3\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}: \hspace{10pt}\Delta H^{\circ}_{r1} = -1559.8 \textrm{kJ/mol}$

 2. $\textrm{C} + \textrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \textrm{C}\textrm{O}_2: \hspace{10pt}\Delta H^{\circ}_{r2} = -393.5 \textrm{kJ/mol}$

 3. $\textrm{H}_2 + \dfrac{1}{2} \textrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}: \hspace{10pt}\Delta H^{\circ}_{r3} = -285.8 \textrm{kJ/mol}$

##

Add $2$ Equation $2$'s to $3$ Equation $3$'s and subtract $1$ Equation $1$


$$
\small{2 \textrm{C} + 3\textrm{H}_2 + 2\textrm{O}_2 + \dfrac{3}{2} \textrm{O}_2 - \dfrac{7}{2} \textrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\textrm{C}\textrm{O}_2 + 3\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} - \textrm{C}\textrm{O}_2 - 3\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{C}_2 \textrm{H}_6}
$$


<br>

$$
4. \hspace{10pt} 2\textrm{C} + 3\textrm{H}_2 \rightarrow \textrm{C}_2 \textrm{H}_6
$$


<br>
$$
\Delta H^{\circ}_{r4} = 2\Delta H^{\circ}_{r2} + 3\Delta H^{\circ}_{r3} - \Delta H^{\circ}_{r1}
$$ 
$$
= 2(-393.5) + 3(-285.8) - (-1559.8) = -84.6 \textrm{kJ/mol}
$$

which is also the heat of formation for ethane.

<br></br>

##

If you use different sets of equations to calculate the same final
equation with Hess’s law, you may find that rounding and
truncation errors keep the results from being identical. In the
back of FRB, the heat of formation for ethane is $–84.67$ $\textrm{kJ/mol}$.

## 


FRB uses units of $\textrm{kJ}$ or $\textrm{Btu}$ for heats of reaction and heats of
formation. I use $\textrm{kJ/mol}$ or $\textrm{Btu/lb-mol}$. Why the difference? FRB
feels that including the basis confuses students. I feel that since

$$
\Delta H = \xi \Delta \hat{H}_r
$$

and

$$
\Delta \hat{H} = \hat{\xi} \Delta \hat{H}_r
$$

<br>

and the units of extent are moles, and the rate of extent are
moles/time, including the basis makes perfect sense.

## The Heat of Combustion

If you have a combustion reaction for a given species, as discussed
in the Combustion Reactions video, the heat of reaction for
complete combustion of one mole of fuel is called the *heat of
combustion*. As a reminder, for the principal species and complete
combustion, the combustion products are $\textrm{C}\textrm{O}_2$, $\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$, and $\textrm{S}\textrm{O}_2$. $\textrm{C}\textrm{O}_2$
and $\textrm{S}\textrm{O}_2$ are gases at standard conditions. What about water?

<br></br>

The accepted convention is to assume water is liquid at $25 \text{ } ^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $1$ atm.
