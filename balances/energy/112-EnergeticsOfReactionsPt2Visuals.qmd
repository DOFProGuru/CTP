## Introduction

*React Hard: The First Law Gets Chemical* and</br>***React Harder: Formation Heats and Alternate Endings***</br>present

- three sets of calculations for the 1^st^ Law in reacting systems.
- based on *A Combustible Mixture!* video
- Review *React Hard: The First Law Gets Chemical* before watching this video.

$$\sum\limits_{\substack{\mathrm{out} \\ \mathrm{streams}}} \dot{n}_j \hat{H}_j\ - \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathrm{in} \\ \mathrm{streams}}} \dot{n}_i \hat{H}_i = \dot{Q},\hspace{120px} \hat{H}_i = \Delta \hat{H}^{\circ}_{f, i} + \int\limits_{T_\mathrm{ref}}^T C_{pi} (T) dT $$

## Which Method?

::: {style="font-size: 95px;"}
- All three gave identical results.
- The heat of reaction method requires you to calculate the heats of reaction.
- The heats of formation method requires you to add the heats of formation to the specified species specific enthalpies.
- The net effort appears to be about the same.

::: {.fragment}
I personally usually use the heat of reaction method because I like to see what the reactions are contributing to the overall energy balance compared to what the sensible heat changes are contributing.
:::

- Either method works.
- Implement your chosen method correctly. 
:::

## The Takeaways

1. All three ways of working the problem gave the same answers.
2. Sometimes you have to do piecewise integration on your heat capacity equations.
3. The method you choose depends on your personal preference.
