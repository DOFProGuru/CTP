## Gibbs Phase Rule

* $\ \ \ \boxed{DF\ =\ 2+c - \Pi}$ 

 1. A Degree of Freedom, DF, is a coordinate or variable.
 2. A Component, $c$, is a chemical species, e.g. $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$.
 3. A Phase, ∏, is a physical entity with a uniform composition, temperature, pressure and specific volume.
 4. For a single component system with one phase $\\ \text{DF} = 2 + 1 – 1 = 2$.
 5. For a single component system with two phases $\\ \text{DF} = 2 + 1 – 2 = 1$.

## In the single-phase region (superheated steam)

* $DF = 2$

* Must specify two properties to define the thermodynamic state

* e.g. What is the specific volume of steam at $5$ bar and $\ \ \ $ $300$ °C?

## In the single-phase region (superheated steam)

e.g. What is the temperature of steam with a specific volume of
$0.500$ $\dfrac{\textrm{m}^3}{\textrm{kg}}$ at $5$ bar?

$\\$

$\dfrac{T - 250}{0.500 - 0.474}\ =\ \dfrac{300 - 250}{0.522-0.474} \hspace{20pt} \Rightarrow T = 277.1 ^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

## In the two-phase region (saturated steam and water)

* $DF = 1$

* Have two phases (water and steam) in equilibrium.

* e.g. What is the temperature, and what are the specific enthalpies
of saturated water and saturated steam at $4.0$ bar?

## In the two-phase region (saturated steam and water)

 We know the properties of the two phases.


 What is the property of the overall mixture?
 

 Define the quality.
 
 $\\$

 $x = \dfrac{\text{m}_{steam}}{\text{m}_{steam} + \text{m}_{water}} = \dfrac{\text{m}_{steam}}{\text{m}_{total}}$
 
 $\\$

 What is the pressure and specific internal energy of a mixture of steam and water at $88 °C$ and a quality of $80$%?
 
 $\\$

 What is the quality of a mixture of steam and water at $0.6495$ bar, and a specific enthalpy of $2000\  \textrm{kJ/kg}$?

$P\ =\ 0.6495$ bar


$\hspace{10pt}$ $\hat{U}_{\text{mix}} = x\hat{U}_{\text{v}}\ +\ (1-x)\hat{U_{\text{l}}} = 0.8\ \cdot 2491 + 0.2\ \cdot 368.4 = 2066.5\ \textrm{kJ/kg}$

What is the quality of a mixture of steam and water at $0.6495$ bar, and a specific enthalpy of $2000\  \textrm{kJ/kg}$?

{image}

$\hat{H}_{\text{mix}} = x\hat{H}_{\text{v}}\ +\ (1-x)\hat{H_{\text{l}}} = x(\hat{H}_{\text{v}} - \hat{H}_{\text{l}}) + \hat{H}_{\text{l}} = x\Delta \hat{H}_{\text{lv}} + \hat{H}_{\text{l}}$

$\\$

$x = \dfrac{\hat{H}_{\text{mix}} - \hat{H}_{\text{l}}}{\hat{H}_{\text{v}} - \hat{H}_{\text{l}}} = \dfrac{2000 - 368.5}{2656 - 368.5} = 0.713 = 71.3$%

$\\$

$x = \dfrac{\hat{H}_{\text{mix}} - \hat{H}_{\text{l}}}{\Delta\hat{H}_{\text{lv}}} = \dfrac{2000 - 368.5}{2288} = 0.713 = 71.3$%
