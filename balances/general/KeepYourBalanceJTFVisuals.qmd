>Engineering is solving story problems where you often have to make up the story.

>Bookkeeping is just arithmetic and definitions, but it needs to be done correctly.

>There are many ways to solve a problem correctly. You want to develop a systematic approach, and not treat each problem as an isolated issue.

 - This video, *How to Keep Your Balance*, discusses systems in chemical and thermal principles and defines the general balance equation.
  - The companion video, *Speed Balancing*, gives additional definitions, hints and suggestions on how to quickly and correctly solve your balance equations for your systems.

## What is a system?

 - The terms *systems* and *processes* are used interchangably.
 - It is a collection of inputs, outputs, and transformations.
   - It may be a single unit process, e.g., a distillation column.
   - It may be a collection, e.g., an oil refinery.
   - It may be more abstract.
 - It is modeled with sets of equations:
   - Conservation laws or balance equations
   - Constitutive equations

## Working with systems

### Define your system type and boundaries

1. Transient or Steady State
    a. Transient – Process variables change with time.
    b. Steady State – Process variables *do not* change with time, but may change with position.
2. How mass crosses the boundary
    a. Batch or Closed – Mass does *not* cross system boundary during processing.
        - In steady-state batch systems, nothing happens.
    b. Continuous or Open – Mass crosses system boundary during processing.
    c. Semibatch – Mass enters or exits, but not both.

## General Balance Equations

$$\mathrm{Input} + \mathrm{Gen.} = \mathrm{Consump.} + \mathrm{Accum.} + \mathrm{Output}$$

- Input – what goes into a system
- Generation – generated within the system
- Output – what comes out of the system
- Consumption – consumed within the system
- Accumulation – accumulated within the system

:::{.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
Generation is the same as negative consumption. Consumption is the same as negative generation. Which side of the equation a specific generation or consumption term goes is usually dictated by convention.

## Chemical and Thermal Process Order{.bigbold85}

1. Material Balances
    - Mass balances
    - Mole balances
2. Energy Balances a.k.a. 1st Law of Thermodynamics
3. Entropy Balances a.k.a. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
4. Exergy Balances, used in process efficiency calculations

:::{.fragment}
For conserved quantities, $\mathrm{Generation} = \mathrm{Consumption} \equiv 0$.
:::

:::{.fragment}
For steady-state systems, $\mathrm{Accumulation} \equiv 0$
:::

## Differential and Integral Balances

- **Differential Balance**

   - All terms are rate terms, e.g., mol/s, gal/hr, pg/yr.
   - Defined for an instant in time.
   - Often actual differential equations.
   - Most often for continuous systems.

- **Integral Balance**

   - All terms are amounts e.g., mol, gal, pg.
   - Defined as change between two times.
   - Most often for batch processes.


## Intensive and Extensive Properties

- **Intensive Property** – Does *not* depend on the mass or moles present.
    - Examples, $T$, $P$, $\rho$, $x_i$
    - Specific or molar properties are intensive.<br/><br/>
- **Extensive Property** – *Depends* on the mass or moles present.
    - Examples, weight, volume
    - Usually has a related intensive property, e.g., $V$, $\hat{V}$.


## The Takeaways

1. Always define your system. You need to decide if it is open, closed, or semibatch, if it is transient or steady state, if it is a control volume or not, if it is insulated or not, and if it is isolated or not.
2. Next you need your balance equation or equations for mass or moles, for energy, for entropy, and/or for exergy.
3. Determine if you need a differential balance or an integral balance.
4. For conserved quantities, the consumption and generation terms are zero.
5. For steady-state systems, the accumulation term is zero.
