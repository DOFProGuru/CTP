## Mass

Mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its
resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net
force is applied. An object's mass also determines the strength of its
gravitational attraction to other bodies. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass)

The SI unit of mass, the kilogram, is defined from Planckâ€™s constant

$$h=6.626070150 \times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{m^2/s}$$

or

$$ 1\ \mathrm{kg}=\frac{h}{6.626070150 \times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{kg \cdot m^2/s}} $$

## Mass (cont.)

For the curious, the second is defined as 9,192,631,770 times the
period of the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition of the
cesium 133 atom. And the meter is defined as 1/299,792,458th of the
distance light travels in a vacuum in one second.
The American engineering unit of mass, the pound mass, or $\mathrm{lb_m}$ is
defined as

$$1\ \mathrm{lb_m} \equiv 0.453\ 592\ 37\ \mathrm{kg}$$

## Mole

- See *What Ia A Mole?* for a more thorough explanation

- The most common moles are
  - $\text{g-mol}$ or $\text{mol}$
  - $\text{kg-mol}$ or $\text{kmol}$
  - $\text{lb-mol}$
  - $\text{ton-mol}$
  - $\text{tonne-mol}$

You should NEVER convert your mass in kg or lbm to g, and then
to g-mol. You should ALWAYS use the kind of mole your mass is
in. The conversion factor is simply the molecular weight.

## Mole (cont.)

The molecular weight of methane is:

MCH4
=16.0425 g
g-mol
=16.0425 kg
kg-mol
=16.0425
lbm
lb-mol
## The Takeaways

1. Pressure is the second most commonly measured process variable.
2. Hydrostatic pressure $= \rho g h$.
3. Manometers measure $\Delta P$'s with hydrostatic pressure.
