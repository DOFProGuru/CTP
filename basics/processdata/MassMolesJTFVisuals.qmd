## Mass

Mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its
resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net
force is applied. An object's mass also determines the strength of its
gravitational attraction to other bodies. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass)

The SI unit of mass, the kilogram, is defined from Planckâ€™s constant

$$h=6.626070150 \times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{m^2/s}$$

or

$$ 1\ \mathrm{kg}=\frac{h}{6.626070150 \times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{kg \cdot m^2/s}} $$

## Mass (cont.)

For the curious, the second is defined as 9,192,631,770 times the
period of the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition of the
cesium 133 atom. And the meter is defined as 1/299,792,458th of the
distance light travels in a vacuum in one second.
The American engineering unit of mass, the pound mass, or $\mathrm{lb_m}$ is
defined as

$$1\ \mathrm{lb_m} \equiv 0.453\ 592\ 37\ \mathrm{kg}$$

## Mole

- See *What Ia A Mole?* for a more thorough explanation

- The most common moles are
  - $\text{g-mol}$ or $\text{mol}$
  - $\text{kg-mol}$ or $\text{kmol}$
  - $\text{lb-mol}$
  - $\text{ton-mol}$
  - $\text{tonne-mol}$

:::{.fragment .absolute Top=70% left=0%}
You should NEVER convert your mass in $\text{kg}$ or $\mathrm{lb_m}$ to $\mathrm{g}$, and then
to $\text{g-mol}$. You should ALWAYS use the kind of mole your mass is
in. The conversion factor is simply the molecular weight.

## Mole (cont.)

The molecular weight of methane is:

$M_\mathrm{CH_4} = 16.0425\ \frac{\text{g}}{\text{g-mol}} = 16.0425\ \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{kg-mol}} = 16.0425\ \frac{\mathrm{lb_m}}{\text{lb-mol}}$

To calculate the pounds of oxygen ($M = 31.9988$) required to completely burn three pounds of methane:

$\mathrm{CH_4} + 2 \mathrm{O_2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO_2} + 2 \mathrm{H_2O} \implies \frac{2\ \text{lb-mol }\mathrm{O_2}}{1\ \text{lb-mol }\mathrm{CH_4}}$

$\frac{3\ \mathrm{lb_m\ CH_4}}{16.0425\ \frac{\mathrm{lb_m\ CH_4}}{\text{lb-mol CH}_4}} \frac{2\ \text{lb-mol }\mathrm{O_2}}{1\ \text{lb-mol }\mathrm{CH_4}} \frac{31.9988\ \mathrm{lb_m\ O_2}}{1\ \text{lb-mol O}_2} = 11.9678\ \mathrm{lb_m\ O_2}$ 

Calculating it any other way is just a waste of time and brain effort.

## Mass Fractions and Mole Fractions

$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all used for both *mass fractions* and *mole fractions*. $x_\mathrm{A}$ can be the mass fraction of species $\mathrm{A}$ or the mole fraction of species $\mathrm{A}$. Likewise for $y_\mathrm{A}$ and $z_\mathrm{A}$. Convention usually uses:

- $x$ for fractions in a solid or liquid mixture,
- $y$ for fractions in a gas mixture, and
- $z$ for the overall fraction in a gas-liquid, liquid-solid, or gas-solid mixture.


## Conversions

To convert from mass fraction, $x$, to mole fraction, $y$:

$y_\mathrm{A} = \frac{\frac{x_\mathrm{A}}{M_\mathrm{A}}}{\sum \frac{x_i}{M_i}}$

To convert from mole fraction, $y$, to mass fraction, $x$:

$x_\mathrm{A} = \frac{y_\mathrm{A} M_\mathrm{A}}{\sum y_i M_i}$

## Mole-Averaged and Mass-Averaged Molecular Weight{.bigbold60}

The mole-averaged (or number-averaged) molecular weight is

$\bar{M} = \sum y_i M_i = \left(\sum \frac{x_i}{M_i}\right)^{-1}$

The mass-averaged molecular weight is

$\bar{M}_m = \sum x_i M_i = \frac{\sum y_i M_i^2}{\sum y_i M_i}$

The mole-averaged molecular weight is most often used for
mixtures of gases. The mass-averaged molecular weight is most
often used for polymers.

## The Takeaways

1. Pressure is the second most commonly measured process variable.
2. Hydrostatic pressure $= \rho g h$.
3. Manometers measure $\Delta P$'s with hydrostatic pressure.
