# Purpose of *What Is a Mole?*

A mole is a basic concept in Chemical Engineering. It's purpose is to determine the masses of reagents
needed in chemical reactions. Unlike in Chemistry, where [a mole is a mole is a mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_is_a_rose_is_a_rose_is_a_rose), in Chemical Engineering engineers need to work with different mass units such as [pounds-mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)) $(\mathrm{lb_m})$, [tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton), and kilograms. For each mass unit there is a corresponding mole. For a chemical species, the numerical value of a mole in a given mass unit doesn't change with the mass unit, but the unit does. For example, with $\mathrm{NaCl}$ that has a molecular mass of $58.443$, a gram-mole (or simply mole) has a mass of $58.443\ \mathrm{g}$, a pound-mole has a mass of $58.443\ \mathrm{lb_m}$ and a ton-mole has a mass of $58.443\ \mathrm{ton}$ (one might have to specify whether the ton is a long ton or a short ton).

The videos explain what a mole is and how it is used in basic Chemical Engineering calculations. 

# *The Full Story* Video

*The Full Story* Video examines common conceptions and misconceptions about moles before explaining what a mole is and how to use a mole. It is recommended for those who have not been exposed to moles before or who have struggled with understanding what a mole is or how it is used.

# Definitions

Avogadro's Number
: Avogadro's number or the Avogadro Constant, $N_\mathrm{A}$ is listed on the N.I.S.T. as
  having a value of $6.022\ 140\ 76 \times 10^{23}/\mathrm{mol}$, where $\mathrm{mol}$ is the gram mole.

Gram Atom
: The gram atom is the name given to an Avogadro's number of atoms. Compare with an Avogadro's number of molecules, called the gram mole.

Molar Mass
: The molar mass of a chemical compound is the ratio between the number of moles of a compound and
  its mass. See Wikipedia [Molar mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_mass) for a more thorough explanation.

Mole or Gram Mole
: A mole (abbreviation $\mathrm{mol}$) or gram mole (abbreviation $\textrm{g-mol}$) is the mass in grams of an Avogadro's number of molecules of a chemical species. For example,
  a mole of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ has a mass of $58.443\ \mathrm{g}$.

Pound Mass
: A pound mass is the mass that exerts a force of one pound force when accelerated at the standard
  gravitational acceleration rate of $32.174\ \mathrm{ft/s^2}$. N.I.S.T lists the pound mass as being the same as $0.453\ 592\ 37\ \mathrm{kg}$. It is abbreviated as $\mathrm{lb_m}$.

Pound Mole
: A pound mole (abbreviation $\textrm{lb-mol}$) is the mass equivalent in pounds mass of the
  molar mass of a chemical species. For
  example, a pound mole of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ has a mass of $58.443\ \mathrm{lb_m}$.
