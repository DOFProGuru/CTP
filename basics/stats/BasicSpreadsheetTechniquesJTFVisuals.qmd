## Why Spreadsheets

* Readily Available
  * Microsoft Office is everywhere.
  * Libre Office is free.
* Google Sheets is “free” and collaborative.
* Apple Numbers is free to Apple owners.
* Tabular format fits process flow diagram annotation.
* Easy to correct errors (if you set it up right).

## Use Microsoft Excel or Libre Office

* Permit widest formatting options, especially graphs.
* Have Goal Seek or equivalent without hoop jumping.
* Have Solver without hoop jumping.

$$\textbf{You can use others if you want}$$
* Just prepare for a lot of extra work.
* I won’t offer tech support.

## Formatting

* For professional use, you can get very fancy.
* For E82, just make things clear, not fancy.
* Think about layout from end-consumer’s perspective.
  * Label things in an obvious way.
  * Group things in an obvious way.
* Code reference data, input parameters, and answers.
  * My code is:
    * Reference data (e.g., R, data from table) Blue
    * Input parameters (what the user can change) Green or Red
    * Answers or results, BOLD
* All graphs must have
  * Units on the axes
  * Legends if more than one data series plotted.

  * Answers or results, BOLD
* Usually has a place for your name and section.
* Fill Formula means to enter, or preferably drag or copy and paste a 
formula.
* Fill Title means to enter a descriptive title for the column or row.
* Fill Value means to enter the value from a reference table or the
problem statement.

refined using either guess and check, or Goal Seek.

changing formatting.
