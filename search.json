    "text": "Many engineers and chemical engineers in particular design, analyze, and create processes that transform inputs, such as chemical reagents, heat, and electricity, into outputs such a other chemical reagents. The design and analysis of processes requires a knowledge of the sorts of measurements or data that are made of the process, and the variables that are used to model the process. This section discusses many of the varibles, measurements, and data that are common to these processes, how they are defined, what they mean, and how they are used, presented, and analyzed.\n\n\nWe begin with units, conversions, and dimensionless numbers. In spite of a desire to perform all calculations in SI unts, the practicing engineer needs to be comfortable working with both familiar and obscure units. This set of videos discusses many of the common techniques for working with diverse units. The videos in this section are:\n\nIs Furlongs per Fortnight a Thing? The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. Dimensional equations are frequently used to convert data, measurements, and variables from one set of units to another. They will not solve all of your unit conversion issues, but they will solve many of them. Google Calculator is usually the easiest way to implement dimensional equations, but by no means the only way. Dimensional equations are used when units are multiplicatively related to each other.\nConverting Temperatures The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. Converting temperatures and temperature intervals among \\(\\mathrm{K}\\), \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\\), \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{F}\\), and \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{R}\\) applies the principles discussed in the previous two video sets. Because temperature is such an important measurement, datum, or variable, these videos discuss precisely how to make these conversions.\nThe Most Annoying Equation Conversion The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. When units have a more complex relationship than simply multiplicative, such as \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\\) and \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{F}\\), the relationship is expressed in an equation with dimensions. In addition, there are at times equations, particularly empirical equations, where the varibles are in SI units, and you need an equivalent equation in American Engineering units. The procedure for deriving such equations with units is presented in this set of videos.\nDimensionless Numbers The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. In the early days of engineering there were huge data sets that needed to be regressed and correlations found. The Buckingham pi theorem provided a way to reduce the dimensionality of these huge data sets and ease calculational complexity. In addition, normalizing ordinary and partial differential equations (which is basically making the variables dimensionless through choosing a scale) gives rise to dimensionless prarameters. The most well known of these is the Reynolds number, but there are scores of others. This set of videos discusses dimensionless parameters and dimensionless numbers, where they come from, and how they are used.\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring Temperature The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. The most commonly measured process variable is temperature. This set of videos discusses different temperature-measurement techniques. It is optional because at this level it is not necessary to know how to measure a temperature, but it is valuable for anyone who actually needs to measure a temperature or has to specify how a temperature measurement is to be made.\n\n\n\nThe second most commonly measured process variable is pressure.\n\nUnder Pressure Part 1 The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. Part 1 discusses the common pressure units and hydrostatic pressure.\nUnder Pressure Part 2 The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. Part 2 discusses absolute, atmospheric, barometric, gauge, and vacuum pressure.\n\n\n\n\nWhen purchasing, ordering, selling, or processing raw materials and chemical reagents, one has to specify the mass or weight of solids, the mass, weight, or volume of liquids, and the mass or pressure and volume of gases. However, when calculating the amount needed for a given chemical reaction, the number of moles needed needs to be calculated. The practicing engineer needs to be able to convert back and forth between mass and moles. The two video sets in this series are:\n\nWhat Is a Mole? The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. This video set explains the different types of moles and how to use them.\nWhat the Frac? The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page When dealing with mixtures, there are times that one needs to calcuate what mass fraction of each species is present and times to calculate the mole fraction of each species. This video explains how to calculate mass and mole fractions, how to convert between the two, and how to calculate mass- and mole-averaged molecular weight.\n\n\n\n\nIn Chemical and Thermal Processes, the flows are often calculated and/or measured as mass flow rates, molar flow rates and/or volumetric flow rates. The video explains how the three flow rates are defined, and how to convert among them. The video is Are You Dense? Crank Up the Volume and Go With the Flow!

They will not solve all of your unit conversion issues, but they will solve many of them. Google Calculator is usually the easiest way to implement dimensional equations, but by no means the only way. Dimensional equations are used when units are multiplicatively related to each other.\nConverting Temperatures The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. Converting temperatures and temperature intervals among \\(\\mathrm{K}\\), \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\\), \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{F}\\), and \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{R}\\) applies the principles discussed in the previous two video sets. Because temperature is such an important measurement, datum, or variable, these videos discuss precisely how to make these conversions.\nThe Most Annoying Equation Conversion The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. When units have a more complex relationship than simply multiplicative, such as \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\\) and \\(^\\circ\\mathrm{F}\\), the relationship is expressed in an equation with dimensions. In addition, there are at times equations, particularly empirical equations, where the varibles are in SI units, and you need an equivalent equation in American Engineering units. The procedure for deriving such equations with units is presented in this set of videos.\nDimensionless Numbers The Full Story, Just The Facts, Reference Page. In the early days of engineering there were huge data sets that needed to be regressed and correlations found. The Buckingham pi theorem provided a way to reduce the dimensionality of these huge data sets and ease calculational complexity. In addition, normalizing ordinary and partial differential equations (which is basically making the variables dimensionless through choosing a scale) gives rise to dimensionless prarameters. The most well known of these is the Reynolds number, but there are scores of others. This set of videos discusses dimensionless parameters and dimensionless numbers, where they come from, and how they are used."

It is often necessary to measure or specify the composition of these mixtures. The two standards for specifying composition are by mass fraction and by mole fraction. The purpose of this video is to discuss mass, review the mole as used in engineering, explain how to calculate mass fractions and mole fractions, and how to convert bach and forth between them. Finally, it discusses how to calculate both mass-averaged and mole- or number-averaged molecular weight for a mixture. The engineering use of moles was discussed at length in What Is a Mole?."

    "text": "Why Statistics and Measurements\nAll chemical and thermal processes have one or more outputs, whether it be a chemical product such as benzene or electrical power. The goal of almost all process engineers is to maximize the output for a given cost or minimize the cost for a given output. Engineering is a quantitative discipline, and we have to quantitatively report our inputs and outputs. Since all processes experience random fluctuations from the process itself or from the measurement process, the engineer needs to be able to account for the noise. Statistical methods are the most common ways to report both the inputs and outputs, and the variations or noise in the inputs or outputs. There are seventeen videos discussing common statistical methods used in Chemical and Thermal Processing and other fields of engineering, divided up into basic statistics, linear regression, error propagation, nonlinear regression, and error propagation in integrals and derivatives\n\n\nBasic Statistics\nThe most commonly used basic statistics are the arithmetic mean, the standard deviation, and the confidence interval. These three are covered in the videos and web pages listed in the table below. The column labeled JTF contains links to the Just The Facts videos, intended mainly for review. The TFS videos are The Full Story videos, with more explanation and discussion. The Info Page contains additional information and definitions for the videos.\n\n\n\nTitle\nJTF Link\nTFS Link\nInfo Page\nSubject\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Deviant and Mean Are Your Data?

    "text": "&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: How would you use a mole?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE: I would, uh, eat it!\n&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: What is a mole is an episode of the Degrees of Freedom Project, “The Full Story” videos on chemical and thermal principles. If you want the “Just The Facts” version without the in-depth discussion, use the link in the description. Definitions and additional details can be found in the web-page link in the description as well.\n&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: When we are talking about Chemical Engineering, what is a mole?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE1: What is a mole?\n&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE1: I have no idea.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE2: Uhmmm, I forgot.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE3: Like a size, like a use, like a metric, kinda? I forgot the number, it’s like six point six oh eight point zero two two one.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE4: Some unit of like how many molecules there are. I guess it could also be an animal, but that’s not really a thing for Chemical Engineering.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE5: A mole is a unit of measurement. So the mole is just a number. Uhmm 6.02 times 10 to the 23. basically it’s a way of measuring atoms so that uhmm we can put them on a scale that is somewhat reasonable like to have and like use in the lab\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: And then, when we are talking about Chemical Engineering, what is a pound-mole?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE6: Uhh, I’m not too sure.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE7: I have no clue.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE8: No clue.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE9: I have no clue what that is.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE10: I presume it’s some horrific cursed unit that Engineers came up with where they they do this insane thing where they combine like US imperial units with like metric units, and it’s just like the worst thing ever.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE11: Probably like a certain number of moles that weigh a pound.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE12: A pound-mole would be the number of molecules of something in a pound of that something.\n&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A mole is the name given to the mass equivalent of the molar mass of a molecule. For example, a molecule of carbon dioxide has a molar mass of approximately 44.01, that means a gram mole, or simply a mole, of carbon dioxide has a mass of 44.01 grams, subsequently a pound-mole of carbon dioxide has a mass of 44.01 pounds mass.\nTo help you understand, this is one gram mole of table salt, and this is one pound-mole of table salt.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: How would you use a mole?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE1: How would I use it?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: Uh Huh\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE1: Without knowing what it is?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: Uh Huh\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE1: I would eat it?!\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE2: I have no idea actually. Like for problems? Like I don’t know.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE3: Like you can convert it to other units.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE4: One mole of this element plus two moles of some other element might go to, combine to form certain compounds, so like balancing equations.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE5: Balancing like chemical equations, like in stoichiometry you want to make sure yout number of moles um in is equal to your number of moles out.\n&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: So how do I use a mole? A mole is most useful when planning out or preparing reagents for a chemical reaction. You really need to start with a balanced chemical equation for the reaction. For example, one carbon atom and one oxygen molecule react to form one molecule of carbon dioxide.\nIf you wanted to make 100 pounds of carbon dioxide, you would need to calculate what mass of carbon atoms you would need, and what mass of oxygen molecules you would need. For an atomic species like carbon, you are technically supposed to use the name pound-atom or gram-atom, but in casual conversation, if you use the term pound-mole or gram-mole most engineers will understand.\nThe chemical equation means that one pound-atom of carbon will react with one pound-mole of oxygen molecules (which is just two pound-atoms of oxygen atoms) in order to form one pound-mole of carbon dioxide. Given that the molar mass (also called molecular weight) of carbon dioxide is about 44.01, 100 pounds of carbon dioxide is 100 divided by 44.01 or 2.272 pound-moles of carbon dioxide.\nWe need 2.272 pound-atoms of carbon and 2.272 pound-moles of oxygen molecules.\nThe atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12.01, and the molar mass of oxygen is about 32.00, so we need 2.272 times 12.01\nand 2.272 times 32.00\nThat gives us totals of 27.29 pounds of carbon\nand 72.70 pounds of oxygen in order to make our 100 pounds of carbon dioxide\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWER: And then do you know what Avogadro’s number is?\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE1: I don’t.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE2: I have no idea what exactly it is.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE3: Something times 10 to the 27th.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE4: 1.602 times 10 to the 23rd.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE5: 6.02 times 10 to the 23 molecules per gram.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE6: Avogadro’s number is the number you use to convert um moles to molecules back and forth.\n&gt;&gt; INTERVIEWEE7: Avogadro’s constant is 6.023 to 10 to the power 23 if I remember correctly.\n&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For a gram-mole, which is what chemists mean when they say mole, the international standards agencies have agreed on how many molecules are in exactly one mole. In the US, our standards agency is the National Institute of Standards and Technology or N.I.S.T. The value from their website is 6.022 140 76 times 10 to the 23rd per mol. That number is known as Avogadro’s number or the Avogadro constant.\nHowever, there is a corresponding number for each mass unit. For pounds mass the exact number is 1.327 654 687 336 03 times 10 to the 27th per pound-mole.\nThe N.I.S.T. website lists at least 15 different mass units, so there are at least that many types of moles, ranging from the carat-mole through the pennyweight-mole. The most common moles are the gram mole or mole, the kilogram-mol or kilomole, the metric-ton-mole or tonne-mole, the pound-mole, and the ton-mole.\nThe big question is “Why Can’t I Just Use the Mol that I’m Familiar With?” Well, you can, but you are more likely to make an error because of the extra conversions you have to do. There is a long conversion process if you use any mass unit other than the gram (which isn’t the SI unit, by the way. The SI unit is the kilogram.) The process is as follows: Starting with mass: First, convert mass unit to grams\nSecond, convert from grams to gram moles with the molar mass.\nThird, use the chemical equation to find the resultant gram moles\nFourth, convert from gram-moles to grams, then.\nThen finally, five, convert from grams to your original mass unit.\nDon’t do this!\nRather, you should use the next three simple steps, instead:\nFirst, convert from mass to moles with the molar mass.\nSecond, use the chemical equation to find the resultant moles.\nThen third and finally, convert from moles to mass.\nInstead of five steps, you have three steps, resulting in 40% fewer places to make a mistake.\nThe key takeaways are: First, Engineers use different types of moles because they have to work with different types of mass units.\nSecond, the molar mass is just the conversion factor between moles and mass, and it has the same numerical value regardless of the mass units involved.\nFinally, only use gram moles if your problem is being worked in grams.\nThanks for watching!

    "text": "A mole is a basic concept in Chemical Engineering. It’s purpose is to determine the masses of reagents needed in chemical reactions. Unlike in Chemistry, where a mole is a mole is a mole, in Chemical Engineering engineers need to work with different mass units such as pounds-mass \\((\\mathrm{lb_m})\\), tons, and kilograms. For each mass unit there is a corresponding mole. For a chemical species, the numerical value of a mole in a given mass unit doesn’t change with the mass unit, but the unit does. For example, with \\(\\mathrm{NaCl}\\) that has a molecular mass of \\(58.443\\), a gram-mole (or simply mole) has a mass of \\(58.443\\ \\mathrm{g}\\), a pound-mole has a mass of \\(58.443\\ \\mathrm{lb_m}\\) and a ton-mole has a mass of \\(58.443\\ \\mathrm{ton}\\) (one might have to specify whether the ton is a long ton or a short ton).\nThe videos explain what a mole is and how it is used in basic Chemical Engineering calculations."

    "text": "Why Engineering Calculations\nWhile Engineering Design is the fundamental function of engineers, engineering is a quantitative discipline. Processes must be modeled and optimized. Lengths, masses, flow rates, and temperatures must be specified. Calculation procedures must be performed correctly to produce the designs and artifacts that are the output of the design process. Many common Engineering presentation and calculation tasks are presented in the following videos.\n\n\nWhat Goes Into a Number?\nMost students learn either before or early in their academic career that numbers are frequently used to represent objects in the real world, beginning with natural numbers to represent whole objects like apples or coins, followed by integers to represent both object you have and objects you owe, and then fractions and decimal fractions to represent portions of a whole object, and so forth.\nWhen an engineer uses a number, it is important to recognize what the number represents, what measure of uncertainty or certainty is associated with the number, and what the implications are when that number is transformed through functions and calculations. The video What Goes Into a Number? explores all of these issues and more. It is a meta view of the uses, meanings, and transformations of all of the numbers that engineers use, and hopefully don’t misuse. For consistency the links are presented in a single row table. The column labeled JTF contains links to the Just The Facts videos, intended mainly for review. The TFS videos are The Full Story videos, with more explanation and discussion. The Info Page contains additional information and definitions for the videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nJTF Link\nTFS Link\nInfo Page\nSubject\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Goes Into a Number?\nNo\nNo\nNo\nThe uses, meanings, and transformations of numbers used in Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization\nThe field of data visualization is too vast to explore in depth here. The video linked below is an entrance into the field and explores linear, semi-log, and log-log plots as a means to quickly determine the best functional form for a model for a set of data. It also briefly introduces nonlinear data fitting. These topics are also explored in the statistics videos on linear and nonlinear regression, and in the videos further down this page. Some overlap is unavoidable in a collection of videos. For consistency the links are presented in a single row table.

Interpolation methods are introduced in the videos listed in the table below. The column labeled JTF contains links to the Just The Facts videos, intended mainly for review.

One of the most versatile and underutilized tools is the spreadsheet. Even companies and organizations that can’t afford commercial CAD or mathematical modeling tools will almost always have an office suite that contains a spreadsheet. There are many free and open-source spreadsheets, such as LibreOffice - Calc, Apache OpenOffice Calc, and Gnumeric.
