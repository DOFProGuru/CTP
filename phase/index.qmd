# Explanation

The introductory videos on phase equilibria are found in the [Liquid and Gas Properties](../balances/material/#liquid-and-gas-properties) and [Multiphase Equilibria](../balances/material/#multiphase-equilibria) of the [Material Balances](../balances/material/index.qmd) page. For the more advanced material we hope to have the pahse equilibria portion of [Engineering 134, Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/E134/index.md.html), converted to videos. In the meantime, [here is the link](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/E134/index.md.html) to the course website from Fall 2023. The material is based on a copyrighted textbook, and no effort has been made to convert things to Creative Commons or Open Source, but we hope you find the material useful in the meantime.
